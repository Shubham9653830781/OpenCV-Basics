9. Setup Instructions

âœ… Step-by-Step:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/opencv-basics-guide.git
cd opencv-basics-guide

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run a script:

python 01_Introduction_to_OpenCV/basic_operations.py
