# Understanding Color Spaces in OpenCV

Color spaces allow us to represent and manipulate colors differently for specific tasks. OpenCV supports many color spaces including BGR, RGB, HSV, LAB, and more.

## üîç What You'll Learn
- Convert images to different color spaces
- Visualize HSV color channels
- Mask and isolate specific colors in an image

## ‚ú® Key Functions Covered
- `cv2.cvtColor()`
- `cv2.inRange()`
- `cv2.bitwise_and()`

## üìå Applications
- HSV color filtering for object tracking
- LAB and YCrCb for illumination-insensitive processing
- BGR to RGB conversion for display in matplotlib
