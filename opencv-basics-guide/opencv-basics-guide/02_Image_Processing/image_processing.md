# Image Processing in OpenCV

This section focuses on applying fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn
- Convert color images to grayscale
- Apply image smoothing techniques
- Detect edges using the Canny method

## ✨ Key Functions Covered
- `cv2.cvtColor()`
- `cv2.GaussianBlur()`
- `cv2.Canny()`

## 📌 Techniques
1. **Grayscale Conversion**: Reduces a 3-channel (RGB) image to a single-channel image, simplifying further processing.
2. **Blurring**: Helps reduce image noise and detail.
3. **Edge Detection**: Finds boundaries of objects using gradient information.

This foundational processing is essential for tasks like contour detection, object tracking, and segmentation.
