# Image Thresholding in OpenCV

Thresholding is a technique to segment an image by turning it into a binary image — separating objects from the background.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn
- Apply basic binary thresholding
- Use adaptive thresholding for uneven lighting
- Understand threshold types like `cv2.THRESH_BINARY`, `cv2.THRESH_OTSU`

## ✨ Key Functions Covered
- `cv2.threshold()`
- `cv2.adaptiveThreshold()`
- Threshold types like `THRESH_BINARY`, `THRESH_BINARY_INV`, etc.

## 📌 Applications
- Document scanning
- Object detection and shape analysis
- Preprocessing for contour detection
